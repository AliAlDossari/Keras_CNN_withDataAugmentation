# Keras_CNN_withDataAugmentation
Building a CNN for multi-class classification using Tensorflow and Keras with an application of data augmentation.

The task will be to build a `CNN` model using `Tensorflow` and `Keras` that can classify the Rock, Paper, Scissors image data set with can be downloaded from [rps_train_validation](https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps.zip) for training and validation and [rps_test](https://storage.googleapis.com/laurencemoroney-blog.appspot.com/rps-test-set.zip) for testing.

The packages used are the following:

- `os`
- `tensorflow`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `PIL`
- `random`
